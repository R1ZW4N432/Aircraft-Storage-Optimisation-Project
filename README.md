# Aircraft-Storage-Optimisation-Project

## Overview

This project focuses on improving the storage efficiency of airplane overhead bins using a digital twin—a virtual 3D model of the cabin storage system. By analyzing real-world data on luggage dimensions, passenger behaviors, and boarding processes, it simulates various storage layouts and configurations to optimize space usage.

## Key Features

- **High-fidelity 3D model of overhead cabin bins and carry-on luggage**
- **Simulations of boarding processes and luggage placement scenarios**
- **Data-driven insights and recommendations for improving boarding efficiency and passenger experience**
- **Flexible layout options that can be adjusted based on airline requirements**

## Who It’s For

- **Airlines**: Improve operational efficiency, reduce boarding times, and enhance passenger satisfaction.
- **Aircraft Manufacturers**: Use data-driven insights to refine cabin storage design.
- **Passengers**: Indirectly benefit from smoother boarding processes and more accessible storage space.

## Outcome

- **Optimized Storage Space**: Actionable solutions for maximizing bin capacity while ensuring ease of access.
- **Reduced Boarding Times**: Improved boarding processes by testing efficient luggage placement scenarios.
- **Improved Passenger Experience**: A smoother travel experience with less worry about overhead bin space.
